- use xmodem file load / cancel (fast) instead of md5sum (slow)
- refactor carvera to maintain state better, stream hand-off
- dialog for editing config items (possibly more select)
- tracking of %, gcode sliding window, progressive render of moves
- show origin if it can be retrieved, not just set
